# SWATandR 0.5

### Critical fix
This updated fixes issue #38 where simulations hang up on Windows. The reason is a major update for the `readr` package that introduced lazy reading with version 2.0. Lazy reading causes issues on Win systems and locks files that cannot be deleted and rewritten. This causes simulations to run dead. Please also update the `readr` package with this updated of `SWATandR`. 


# SWATandR 0.4

### Major updates:

- **Parameter conditions for SWAT+**:
  With this release a parameter conditioning is now possible for SWAT+ that is in its syntax similar to the one that was already possible for SWAT2012. This allows now to define parameter changes based on characteristics such as `unit`, `hsg`, `texture`, `landuse`, `plant`, or `slope`, among others.
- Reintroduction of the conditioning variable `layer` for SWAT2012 parameter conditioning. Fixes issue #32
- Move to `processx` instead of `system` for running executables. This fixes issues with running on Unix Systems
- Errors in model runs are now logged in the simulation outputs. This results in more stable simulations and provides information on failed model runs.

### Minor (internal) updates
- Updated parameter reading and writing for SWAT2012 parameters
- Update and fix parameter conditioning syntax translation for SWAT2012 


### Fixed issues:
- Fixed issue #42 
- Fixed issue with warning message `> Warning: Missing column names filled in: 'X6' [6]`
- Fixed issues with `case_when` in SWAT2012 parameter modification routine
- Fix issue #32
- Fix issue #23


# SWATandR 0.3.2

### Major additions:

- Update routines to be compatible with R 4.0.x
- Major modification of outputs of `define_output()`. This was critical to speed up the output reading routine with a large number of output variables.
- Implement error logging of failed SWAT simulation runs.

### Minor additions:
- Add a start and end date check routine
- Implement input argument `revision` in `run_swatplus()` as workaround for failing revision check.
-minor updates in the function help files.

### Major issues:
- Fix wrong paths in the run SWAT batch files on Windows.
- Fix critical issue with modification of .mgt parameters in SWAT2012
- Fix critical issues with reading .hru outputs.

### Minor issues:
- Fix errors with revision checks in SWAT+
- Fix several minor issues with reading .mgt parameters
- Add .rsv parameters to be changeable in SWAT2012.
- Add .aqu parameters to be changeable in SWAT+
- Improve generalization of reading output file structures.
